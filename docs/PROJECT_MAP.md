# Project Map — Amagra

**Updated:** 2026-06-14 · **Version:** v1.0.4
**Mission:** the local-first cognitive runtime developers build agents on top of.

This is the orientation map. Each area links to the canonical document — this file does **not** duplicate their content.

## Current snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | v1.0.4 (tool-using foundations) |
| Specialist agents | 10 (`agents/registry.py` is canonical) |
| Skill graph | 21 nodes |
| Routing accuracy | 97% full · 99% signal-only (curated eval) |
| Memory | SQLite → auto-promote to FAISS at 800 entries · 628+ vectors · P50 0.38ms · 52× LRU cache |
| UCI health | h_UCI ≈ 80.8 |
| API surface | 100+ endpoints (128 routes) |
| Tests | 702 passing |
| Auth | API-key, deny-by-default when `REQUIRE_AUTH=1` |

**Agents (10):** `python_dev` · `dotnet_dev` · `it_networking` · `ai_ml` · `web_dev` · `devops` · `data_analyst` · `writer` · `knowledge_learning` · `terse`

**Cognitive OS:** `event_bus` · `world_model` · `metrics_engine` · `cognitive_state` · `risk_gate` · `skill_graph` · `step_verifier`

Endpoint and UI-tab inventories live in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md); they are not mirrored here to avoid drift.

## Known gaps

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Plan Graph pre-query | Empty state until first compound query runs. |
| gate_accept_rate ~69% | Critic threshold calibrated for stronger models than phi4-mini. |
| Feedback coverage 0% | All quality signals are proxies until real 👍/👎 ratings accumulate. |
